# Wine-Quality-Prediction

This datasets is related to red variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine.The dataset describes the amount of various chemicals present in wine and their effect on it's quality. The datasets can be viewed as classification or regression tasks. The classes are ordered and not balanced (e.g. there are much more normal wines than excellent or poor ones).Your task is to predict the quality of wine using the given data.

A simple yet challenging project, to anticipate the quality of wine.
The complexity arises due to the fact that the dataset has fewer samples, & is highly imbalanced.

Here In this project, I have used classification algorithms for making prediction from 3 to 8.

The data table have following features and target classes:
1.fixed acidity
2.volatile acidity
3.citric acid
4.residual sugar
5.chlorides
6.free sulfur dioxide
7.total sulfur dioxide
8.density
9.pH
10.sulphates
11.alcohol

Output variable (based on sensory data):
12 - quality (score between 3 and 8)

Here quality score of wine 3 represent very poor quality and 8 excellent quality of wine, and remaining classes in between.
